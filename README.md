# lein-sitemap

A Leiningen plugin to do many wonderful things.

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[lein-sitemap "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
lein-sitemap 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-sitemap "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein sitemap
