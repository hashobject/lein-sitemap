# lein-sitemap

A leiningen plugin to resubmit sitemaps in Google Webmaster Tools.

See Google [documentaion](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=183669) about resubmitting sitemaps.

## Usage

FIXME: Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[lein-sitemap "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile.

FIXME: Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-sitemap "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

FIXME: and add an example usage that actually makes sense:

    $ lein sitemap
